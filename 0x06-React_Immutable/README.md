# 0x06-React_Immutable

Welcome to the **0x06-React_Immutable** project! This project explores immutability in JavaScript with a focus on using the **Immutable.js** library and integrating it into React applications. You'll learn how to create, manipulate, and manage immutable data structures effectively to build efficient and predictable React applications.

## **Introduction**

Immutability plays a crucial role in creating predictable and maintainable applications, especially in frameworks like React. Immutable.js provides efficient data structures like `List`, `Map`, and `Seq`, allowing developers to manage application state with ease and ensure consistent updates.

---

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand the importance of immutability in JavaScript and React applications.
2. Utilize the Immutable.js library to create and manage immutable data structures.
3. Differentiate between `List` and `Map` in Immutable.js.
4. Perform operations like `merge`, `concat`, and deep merging.
5. Leverage lazy evaluation using `Seq` for performance optimization.

## **Project Requirements**

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn for dependency management
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode)
