# React State and Lifecycle Project

A project exploring React concepts including state, lifecycle, controlled components, forms, context, React hooks, and testing with Enzyme.

## Features

- **State & Lifecycle**: Understand component state and lifecycle methods in both class and functional components.
- **setState & Callbacks**: Use `setState` with optional callbacks in class components.
- **Context API**: Share data across components without prop drilling.
- **Controlled Components & Forms**: Handle form input with controlled components.
- **Lifting State Up**: Manage shared state by lifting it to a common parent.
- **React Hooks**: Utilize built-in and custom hooks for state management and side effects.
- **Testing with Enzyme**: Test component interactions, state, and lifecycle methods.
