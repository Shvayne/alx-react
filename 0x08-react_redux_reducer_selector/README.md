# 0x08-react_redux_reducer_selector

This project focuses on understanding and implementing key concepts of state management in React applications using Redux. You'll learn how to create reducers, handle state immutability, use selectors for efficient state access, and manage normalized state structures using tools like Normalizr.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the purpose of reducers and their role in Redux.
- Write pure reducers that avoid mutations and handle state immutably.
- Use tools like `Immutable.js` to enforce immutability in state management.
- Normalize complex state structures using `Normalizr`.
- Create and use selectors to access and compute derived state efficiently.
